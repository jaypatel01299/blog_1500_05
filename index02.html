            <p>Artificial intelligence uses computers and machines to simulate </p>
             <p>the human mind's problem-solving and decision-making skills.   
            </p>
                <h2>Weak AI</h2>
        <p>Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), is AI that has been </p>
        <p>     trained to perform specific tasks. The majority of the AI that surrounds us today is driven by weak AI.</p>
        <p>    'Narrow' may be a more accurate descriptor for this type of AI, as it is far from weak; it enables some powerful</p>
        <p>    applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and self-driving cars. </p>
