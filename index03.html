                <h2 class="heading 1">About Solar Technology</h2>

        <p>    Solar technologies use photovoltaic (PV) panels or mirrors to concentrate solar radiation to transform</p>
        <p>    sunlight into electrical energy.</p>
        <p class="pp">    This energy can be converted into electricity or stored in batteries or thermal storage.</p>  

                <h2>Solar Cells: Costs, Challenges, and Design</h2>

        <p>     Over the last two decades, the costs of solar cells, which convert light energy into electricity,</p>
        <p>          have steadily decreased. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a US government lab that researches</p> 
        <p>         solar cell technology, estimates factors that contribute to solar's increasing affordability.</p>
        <p>         They estimate that hard costs, which include the physical solar cell hardware, and soft costs, </p>
        <p>             which include labour or the costs of obtaining necessary government permits, are roughly equal.</p>
        <p>         Because there are more potential consumers and installation experts for new solar cells, soft costs have </p>
        <p>             decreased, allowing companies to produce solar cells in bulk and easily install them. Hard costs are</p>
        <p>         less than half of what they were in 2000, owing primarily to decreased inflation. </p>
        <p>    applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and self-driving cars. </p>
