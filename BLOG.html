            <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a website </br>
                 goes beyond aesthetics to include the websiteâ€™s overall functionality. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, </br> 
                 and user interface design. 
            </p>

        <p>A good web design is simple to use, aesthetically pleasing, and appropriate for the website's user group and brand.</br>
            Many websites are designed with a focus on simplicity in mind, so that no unnecessary information or functionality </br>
            that may distract or confuse users appears. Because the keystone of a web designer's outcome is a site that wins </br>
            and helps build the trust of the target audience, removing as many prospective points of user frustration as possible </br>
            is essential. </p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence uses computers and machines to simulate </p>
             <p>the human mind's problem-solving and decision-making skills.   
            </p>
                <h2>Weak AI</h2>
        <p>Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), is AI that has been </p>
        <p>     trained to perform specific tasks. The majority of the AI that surrounds us today is driven by weak AI.</p>
        <p>    'Narrow' may be a more accurate descriptor for this type of AI, as it is far from weak; it enables some powerful</p>
        <p>    applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and self-driving cars. </p>

                <h2 class="heading 1">About Solar Technology</h2>

        <p>    Solar technologies use photovoltaic (PV) panels or mirrors to concentrate solar radiation to transform</p>
        <p>    sunlight into electrical energy.</p>
        <p class="pp">    This energy can be converted into electricity or stored in batteries or thermal storage.</p>  

                <h2>Solar Cells: Costs, Challenges, and Design</h2>

        <p>     Over the last two decades, the costs of solar cells, which convert light energy into electricity,</p>
        <p>          have steadily decreased. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a US government lab that researches</p> 
        <p>         solar cell technology, estimates factors that contribute to solar's increasing affordability.</p>
        <p>         They estimate that hard costs, which include the physical solar cell hardware, and soft costs, </p>
        <p>             which include labour or the costs of obtaining necessary government permits, are roughly equal.</p>
        <p>         Because there are more potential consumers and installation experts for new solar cells, soft costs have </p>
        <p>             decreased, allowing companies to produce solar cells in bulk and easily install them. Hard costs are</p>
        <p>         less than half of what they were in 2000, owing primarily to decreased inflation. </p>
        <p>    applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, IBM Watson, and self-driving cars. </p>

        <ARTICLE>
            <p>According to economists, robotic systems could take more than 20 million</p> 
            <p>manufacturing jobs worldwide by 2030. According to new Oxford Economics research,</p>  
          <p>14 million robots could be put to work in China alone over the coming 11 years. </p>
            <p>Economists examined long-term trend lines in the adoption of workplace automated processes,</p> 
            <p>noting that the amount of robots in use globally increased threefold over the last 2 decades to 2.1 trillion.</p>
