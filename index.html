            <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a website </br>
                 goes beyond aesthetics to include the websiteâ€™s overall functionality. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, </br> 
                 and user interface design. 
            </p>

        <p>A good web design is simple to use, aesthetically pleasing, and appropriate for the website's user group and brand.</br>
            Many websites are designed with a focus on simplicity in mind, so that no unnecessary information or functionality </br>
            that may distract or confuse users appears. Because the keystone of a web designer's outcome is a site that wins </br>
            and helps build the trust of the target audience, removing as many prospective points of user frustration as possible </br>
            is essential. </p>
